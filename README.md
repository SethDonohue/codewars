### Code Wars Repo for Daily Challenges

Read through the challenge and make sure everyone understands what is being asked.

Pseudocode your solution on the whiteboard. You can each take turns in this process, or select one person to do all the writing, but each team member must participate in the discussion. Pseudocode can be described as writing out your plan in human-readable form. For example, set up a counter or multiply each value by 2.

You should not be writing any actual code, only referencing Code Wars for the problem domain.

Take a picture of your whiteboard pseudocode solution. Make sure each team member has a copy of the picture. This will be included in your personal repo and is part of the individual assignment requirements for full points.

You may then continue to work with your partner or part ways to work independently. You should now move on to attempting to write the solution on Code Wars.

You'll know your solution is correct when all of the tests pass and turn green. Only then can you add your solution to your repo.
